# SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity. #

## Description ##

### Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder for your Enterprise

SurveyJS is **the most advanced yet easy-to-use form builder,** perfect for enterprises of any size. You can use it to build something as simple as a Contact or Feedback form, or to handle more complex use cases, such as an Application form with dynamic fields whose values are calculated and set based on the user's input and pre-defined conditions.

### Flexible Configuration Options

**Every single element of your form is fully customizable**, starting from titles and helper texts, to placeholder texts  and error messages - all to make sure you can provide your respondents with tailored guides and instructions and ensure high-quality user experience.

### Diverse Question types
Unlike the vast majority of form builders, SurveyJS goes far beyond common question types such as Single line input (date, email, name, surname etc.), Long text, Rating and Radio button group. Among some more advanced form elements that you can use are:

- [**Single-Select Dropdown**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/create-dropdown-menu-in-javascript/reactjs)
- [**Multi-Select Dropdown**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/how-to-create-multiselect-tag-box/reactjs) **(Tag Box)**
- [**Image Picker**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/image-picker-question/reactjs)
- [**Multiple Textboxes**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/multiple-text-box-question/reactjs)
- [**Ranking**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/add-ranking-question-to-form/reactjs)
- [**Select Items to Rank**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/select-items-to-rank/reactjs)
- [**HTML**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/questiontype-html/reactjs)
- [**Image Capture**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/photo-capture/reactjs)
- [**Single-Select Matrix**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/single-selection-matrix-table-question/reactjs)
- [**Multi-Select Matrix**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/questiontype-matrixdropdown/reactjs)
- [**Dynamic Matrix**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/questiontype-matrixdynamic/reactjs)

### Features
Besides offering a wide variety of question elements, SurveyJS enables you to implement some advanced features, including:

- [**Calculations**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/questiontype-matrixdynamic-totals/reactjs) - to dynamically calculate values based on user input or predefined variables and display the calculated values in your form or survey.
- [**Carry Forward Responses**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/survey-carry-forward/reactjs#content-docs) - to copy choices from one question (the source) to another (the target). 
- [**Side Navigation**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/table-of-contents/reactjs) **(Table of Contents)** - to help users to quickly navigate through longer surveys.
- [**Progress bar**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/configure-form-navigation-with-progress-indicators/reactjs)  - to show users how many completed pages, answered questions, or valid answers have been given.
- [**Input validation**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/javascript-form-validation/reactjs) - to ensure that respondents fill out all required form fields and the format of values is correct before they are submitted.
- [**Panels**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/set-properties-on-multiple-questions-using-panel/reactjs) - to group questions and configure settings for several questions at once. 
- [**Duplicate group option**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/dynamic-matrix-table-question-with-dropdown-cell-type/reactjs) - to save time and effort by allowing users to quickly clone a set of questions or elements without having to recreate them manually.
- [**Multi-file upload**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/file-upload/reactjs) - to enable respondents to upload multiple files of a required format within one file upload field. Once uploaded, files can be managed in the preview mode.
- [**Join identifier**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/merge-question-values/reactjs) - to link several questions within a form together and sync their values.

### Display and Skip Logic
To simplify the process of setting up conditional rules, SurveyJS ships with a **dedicated GUI for conditional rules** that makes the process simple for everyone. For example, you can set a rule that defines the [visibility of the next question](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/conditional-logic-and-branching-in-surveys/reactjs) based on a given answer, or you can [customize the text of the Thank you page](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/nps-question/reactjs#) based on how the respondent answered your questions.

### Styling
But this is not all! **SurveyJS Theme Editor gives you the power to effortlessly customize survey UI themes and create unique survey looks** tailored to your application. And here's the exciting part: we've included a [collection of predefined themes](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/manage-default-themes-and-styles#add-surveyjs-themes-to-your-application) to help you get started. Just pick a theme as your base, refine it further to align with your brand's aesthetic, and witness real-time changes - from colors to layouts. Notably, our predefined themes prioritize accessibility. Dark mode and a specially designed contrast theme are particularly suited for individuals with visual impairments.

Please also refer to the collection of demos specially designed for various real-life use cases.

### E-signature capture field
SurveyJS offers a simple way to add digital signatures to your e-forms with a build-it input field. This [signature field](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/signature-pad-widget-javascript/reactjs) enables respondents to sign a form with their mouse pointer or even a finger by simply drawing a signature within the signature pad area.
